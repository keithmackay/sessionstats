description: Show the installed sessionstats plugin version and check for updates
---

If the user invokes this command (`/sessionstats:version`), do not run any other workflow. Instead:

1. Read the installed version from this plugin's manifest: `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`'s `"version"` field.
2. Print: `sessionstats v<installed-version>`
3. Best-effort update check — determine this plugin's GitHub source repo:
   a. If `.git` exists here and `git remote get-url origin` resolves to a `github.com` URL, use that `owner/repo`.
   b. Otherwise, search this plugin's own `README.md` for the first `https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>` URL and use that.
   c. If neither yields a repo, or the `gh` CLI isn't installed/authenticated: stop here. Print nothing further — no status line, no error.
4. If a repo was found: run `gh api repos/<owner>/<repo>/releases/latest -q .tag_name` (strip a leading `v`). Compare to the installed version:
   - Equal → append: `Status: up to date`
   - Installed is older → append: `Status: newer version available (v<latest>). To update: if you installed this via a Claude Code marketplace, run /plugin marketplace update <marketplace-name> then reinstall; otherwise, git pull in your install directory if it's a git checkout, or re-copy from https://github.com/<owner>/<repo> per this README's Installation section.`
   - Installed is newer → append: `Status: ahead of latest release (development checkout)`
   - If the API call fails for any reason (network, auth, rate limit, malformed tag): print nothing further — no status line, no error shown to the user.
5. Stop — do not proceed to run any other plugin workflow.
